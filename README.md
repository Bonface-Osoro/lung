# Local-US Neighborhood Geographies of Pulmonary Embolism (lung)
Lung is a county-level exploratory data project focused on understanding pulmonary embolism (PE) mortality trends across the United States from 2005 to 2022. We use the Center for Diseases and Control (CDC) data By combined with spatial analysis and local indicators such as air pollution, socioeconomic conditions, and walkability and understand the patterns of the conditions. Through this project, we aim to uncover geographic patterns and community level factors that shape disparities in PE outcomes. **lung** provides an open framework for integrating diverse datasets, visualizing risk landscapes, and generating insights to inform both public health research and policy interventions.

To this end, we seek to answer the following research questions

  1) What are the spatiotemporal trends in pulmonary embolism (PE) mortality across U.S. counties between 2005 and 2022?
  2) How are county-level indicators including ambient air pollution, socioeconomic status, and walkability associated with geographic variation in PE mortality??
  3) Can integrated spatial models of environmental and socioeconomic determinants identify high-risk counties, and what implications do these findings hold for targeted public health interventions?

## Background and funding

**lung** has been developed by researchers at the Digital Epidemiology (**De**)
laboratory of the **Digital futures** at University of Cincinnati. 

We would like to thank the Geography and GIS Department and **Digital futures** for 
providing the funding for the project. Additionally, we thank the CDC 
authorities for providing the data used in this study.
